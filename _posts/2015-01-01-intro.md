# University in a Pocket
{: .text-purple}


We are students from University of Macau and are trying to research a project relating to Human-Computer Interaction. We are going to introduce an app exclusively for university students!

Currently we are trying to make a prototype for this app (Android only for now). If you are interested, [take a look on GitHub!](https://github.com/GonzalesWu/PocketUniversity)
